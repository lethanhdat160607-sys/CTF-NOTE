### 🧪 Logic Extraction:

I used the  <a href="https://wiki.sleuthkit.org/fls/" target="_blank"> fls </a> command to list the directories in the image file and `-r` to perform a recursive search, listing not only the root directory but also going into every other directory in the disk image. `-m` sets the output mode to Body file format, and `/` directs the root path of the file system in the disk image so that `fls` starts listing and redirects `>body.txt` to a text file instead of directly printing to the screen. 


```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools/CTF1]
└─$ fls -r -m / partition4.img > body.txt
 
                                                                                                                                                           
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools/CTF1]
└─$ ls
body.txt  partition4.img
```

Next, we use the <a href= "https://wiki.sleuthkit.org/mactime/" target="_blank"> mactime </a>
 command, which retrieves a list of raw data and arranges it into a timeline in real-time order. The `-b body.txt` file parameter and the redirection `> timeline.txt` write the entire sorted result to the `timeline.txt` file for easy reference.


```
 ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools/CTF1]
 └─$ mactime -b body.txt > timeline.txt
 Old package separator "'" deprecated at /usr/bin/mactime line 154.
 Old package separator "'" deprecated at /usr/bin/mactime line 167.
                                                                                                                                                           
```

We use the `more` command to print the entire file content to the screen (which can be scrolled more easily using `icat`), and when reading the file, we get lines such as `date, size, event type (MACB), permissions, inode, path`, and notably `bin/bcab` and `usrs/bin/.apk...`.

I used icat to read the inode and saw signs of base64, so I converted it and got the flag.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools/CTF1]
└─$ icat partition4.img 4945

NzFtMzExbjNfMHU3MTEzcl9oM3JfNDNhMmU3YWYK
                                                                                                                                                           
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools/CTF1]
└─$ echo "NzFtMzExbjNfMHU3MTEzcl9oM3JfNDNhMmU3YWYK" | base64 -d
71m311n3_0u7113r_h3r_43a2e7af

```

## Run 
.flag picoCTF{71m311n3_0u7113r_h3r_43a2e7af}
