## 🔍 Challenge 

Download this packet capture and find the flag.
Download packet capture

### 🧪 Logic Extraction:

Open the pcap file on Wireshark and follow the TCP stream. Then, under `tcp.port == 9002`, you'll find a piece of code: `openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt -k supersecretpassword123`. We need to find the packet containing the transmitted data. Usually, you'll find the raw data in the file `file.des3`.

It seems to me that this is the content of an encrypted file, based on the `Salted__`, which is a characteristic indicator of (Magic bytes) of a file encrypted with `OpenSSL`. When you use the `-salt` option, OpenSSL adds 8 random `salt` bytes to the beginning of the file to increase security, and it starts with this ASCII string.

We download the file and run the command `openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt -k supersecretpassword123` to retrieve the flag file and open it.
